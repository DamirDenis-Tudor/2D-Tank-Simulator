- The tanks are classified by color (specific to the teams) and type (each type has its own specific characteristics).
- They have the ability to launch bullets and mines, as well as to heal in the team's spawn zone.
- The map also includes collectible abilities such as SPEED_BOOST, MACHINE_GUN, and INVINCIBILITY. 
- The map is regenerable and includes explosive elements such as barrels.
