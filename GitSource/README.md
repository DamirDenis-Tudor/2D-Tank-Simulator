Project structure : 
=======================

- Game arhiteture is based on **Obsever Pattern**. 
- Starting with the **engine**, each component updates and draws its member components, which in turn do the same and so on.
- This is possible through the implementation of a **Component Interface** and, of course, through **polymorphism**.
